# Covid-Project-
Since I have a biology background I found this dataset relevant in my case and not only because of the past and current situation. Probably this dataset is a good opportunity to show my data analysis skills, until now I worked mostly with the small datasets (experiments that I did during my Ph.D.)

1. **Create a SQL database and import the working table**
2. **Data exploration**
3. **Prepare the queries for data visualization with Tableau:**
  1. total number of deaths
  2. total deaths grouped by continent
  3. highest infection and percentage of infected people from each country
  4. highest infection and percentage of infected people from each country by date. This can be used later to do some prediction in Tableau
